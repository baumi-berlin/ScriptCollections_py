# ScriptCollections_py

This is a collection of scripts I have been creating for py-processing. The scripts are individually designed to specific processing problems from my own work, and may not work in other contexts. Thus, I do not guarantee that the scripts here are working on your machines if you intend to use them. Everyone is invited, however, to scan through the code and extract parts/sections/entire scripts for his/her own work. If you find errors/bugs/etc. feel free to email me --> matthias.baumann@hu-berlin.de
